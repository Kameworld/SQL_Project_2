# Supply_Chain_Beauty_Products_Project

#Abstract
We have a set of 100 different things like clothes and makeup products for a new fashion and beauty business. These things have different factors that affect how much money the business makes and how well it does overall. We want to study these factors to see how they affect important things like what products we have, how much they cost, how long it takes to get them, and how many we have in stock. This helps us understand how to manage our inventory better.
